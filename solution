### 1. What is a List?

# A list in Python is a collection of items, which can be of any data type, organized in a specific order.
# Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation.

# ---

### 2. What is a List Used For?

# Lists are used to store multiple pieces of data in a single variable.
# They allow easy access to each item by its position, making it useful for managing collections of data.

# ---

### 3. What Can Go in a List?

# Lists can contain items of any data type, including:
# - Numbers (integers, floats)
# - Strings
# - Other lists (nested lists)
# - Any other object

# ---

### 4. What is an Item?

# An item is an individual value within a list. Each item in a list has a specific position, called an *index*.

# ---

### 5. What is an Index?

# An index is the position of an item in a list.
# In Python, indexes start at `0` for the first item, `1` for the second item, and so on.

# ---

### 6. How Do You Access Information in a List?

# To access items in a list, use the index in square brackets (`[]`). For example:

# ```python
# Creating a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Accessing the first item
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
# ```
#
# ---

### Example Task

# 1. Create a variable and assign it a list.
# 2. Print the information at position 0.
# 3. Add a string method to the information at position 0.

# ```python
# Step 1: Create a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Step 2: Print the item at position 0
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Step 3: Use a string method on the item at position 0
print(fruits[0].upper())  # Output: APPLE
# ```

# In this example, we use `upper()`, a string method that changes the item to uppercase.
