# 1. Swapping Items in a List
# Given the following list:
# Swap the positions of "apple" and "cherry".
# Print the modified list.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits = ["cherry", "banana", "apple"]
print(fruits)

# 2. Adding Items to a List
# You have a list of animals:

animals = ["dog", "cat", "rabbit"]
animals.append("hamster")
animals.append("parrot")
animals.append("fish")
print(animals)
# Add "hamster", "parrot", and "fish" to the list using the append() method.
# Print the modified list.

# 3. Inserting an Item in the List
# You have the following list:
# Insert "purple" at the 2nd position in the list (index 1).
# Print the modified list.
colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"]
colors.insert(1, "purple")
print(colors)

# 4. Removing an Item Using del
# Consider the following list:
#Remove the 3rd item (index 2) from the list using the del statement.
# Print the modified list.
books = ["To Kill a Mockingbird", "1984", "Moby Dick", "The Great Gatsby"]
del books[2]
print(books)

# 5. Using the pop() Method
# Given this list:
# Use the pop() method to remove and store the last item in the list.
# Print the modified list.
# Also, print the item that was popped out.animals.append()
vehicles = ["car", "bike", "truck", "plane"]
vehicles_popped = vehicles.pop(3)
print(vehicles)
print(vehicles_popped)

# 6. Pop an Item from a Specific Index
# Starting with the list:
# Use the pop() method to remove and store the item at index 1 (i.e., "Bob").
# Print the modified list.
# Print the item that was popped.
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
students_popped = students.pop(1)
print(students)
print(students_popped)

# 7. Reassigning a List Item
# Given the list:
# Change "Canada" to "Argentina".
# Print the modified list.
countries = ["USA", "Canada", "Mexico", "Brazil"]
countries = ["USA", "Argentina", "Mexico", "Brazil"]
print(countries)

# 8. Combining Multiple Modifications
# Start with the list:
# Insert "orchid" at position 1.
# Append "lily", "sunflower", and "lavender".
# Remove the last item.
# Print the final list.
flowers = ["rose", "tulip", "daisy"]
flowers.insert(1, "orchid")
flowers.append("lily")
flowers.append("sunflower")
flowers.append("lavender")
flowers_popped = flowers.pop()
print(flowers)
print(flowers_popped)


# 9. Handling Index Errors
# What will happen if you try to pop an item from an empty list? Write a code that handles this situation and prints an appropriate message.

item_list = []

try:
    items_list_popped = item_list.pop()
    print(items_list_popped)
except IndexError:
    print("Error: Can not pop item from empty list")

print("Current list:", item_list)


# 10. Practice with Negative Indexing
# Given the list:
# Use negative indexing to swap "pie" and "cookies".
# Print the modified list.
desserts = ["ice cream", "pie", "cake", "cookies"]
desserts[-3], desserts[-1] = desserts[-1], desserts[-3]
print (desserts)
