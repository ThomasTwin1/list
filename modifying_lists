# Modifying Lists
# If you want modify items from a list use the following examples:

# Swap item information

cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]

cakes[0] = "chocolate"

print(cakes)

# Add item to list:
cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]
cakes.append("chocolate")
cakes.append("short")
cakes.append("carrot")
print(cakes)
# The append method adds an item to the end of a list without changing it.

# Insert Method
cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]
cakes.insert(3, "ice cream")
print(cakes)
# The insert method adds an item to any desired position in the list
