# Modifying Lists
# If you want modify items from a list use the following examples:

# Swap item information

cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]

cakes[0] = "chocolate"

print(cakes)

# Add item to list:
cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]
cakes.append("chocolate")
cakes.append("short")
cakes.append("carrot")
print(cakes)
# The append method adds an item to the end of a list without changing it.

# Insert Method
cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]
cakes.insert(2, "ice cream")
print(cakes)
# The insert method adds an item to any desired position in the list

# Remove item from list
cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]
del cakes[0]
print(cakes)
# The del statement removes an item at any desired position.
# You no longer have access to the value after you use the del statement.

# The pop method can be used to remove an item from the end of a list, but access it later.
cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]
cakes_popped = cakes.pop()
print("I really like " + cakes_popped + " cake.")

# You can also choose a position to pop
cakes = ["vanilla", "pound", "marble"]
cakes_popped = cakes.pop(1)
print(cakes_popped)
