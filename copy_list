# Copying a list
# You can copy a list by omitting the first and second index ([:]). This is called a shallow copy
# Here is an example:
my_fruits = ["apple","pear","orange","banana","pear"]
friend_fruits = my_fruits[:]
print(f"My friend's favorite fruits are " + ", ".join(friend_fruits))
# Output: My friend's favorite fruits are apple, pear, orange, banana, pear

my_fruits = ["apple","pear","orange","banana","pear"]
friend_fruits = my_fruits[:]
print(f"My friend's favorite fruits are {', '.join(friend_fruits)}")
# Output: My friend's favorite fruits are apple, pear, orange, banana, pear

# In this example we copied the list from my_fruits and stored it in friend_fruit with the shallow copy
