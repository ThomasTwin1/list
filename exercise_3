# How would you define a list that contains numbers, strings, and booleans?

cars = [1, "toyota", True]
print(cars)

# Why would you use a list instead of individual variables for related items?
# Answer: so you can access them from one place

# How can you access the second item in a list called fruits that contains the items ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"]?
fruit = ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"]
print(fruit[-2])

# What does zero-indexed mean in the context of lists in Python?
# Answer; It means the first item in a list always starts with position 0

# If fruits = ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"], what does fruits[3] return?
# Answer: pear

# How can you convert an item in a list to uppercase using string methods?
fruit = ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"]
print(fruit[0].upper())

# Give an example of a list in Python and access the last item in that list.
fruit = ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"]
print(fruit[-1])

# If example_list = [1, "one", True], what will example_list[1] return?
# Answer:[1, "one", True]
example_list = [1, "one", True]
print(example_list)
