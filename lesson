### What is a List?

# A list in Python is a collection of items enclosed in square brackets (`[]`), organized in a specific order.
# Lists can contain items of various types, including:
# - Numbers
# - Strings
# - Booleans
# - Variables
# - Functions
# - Any other data type

# **Example**:
# ```python
# example_list = [1, "one", True]
# ```
#
# ---

### Why Use a List?

# When you want to store and access multiple related items,
# it's best practice to create a list and assign it to a variable. '
# 'This allows easy access to each item.

# **Example**:
# ```python
fruits = ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"]
# ```

# ---

### Accessing Items in a List

# In this course, weâ€™ll refer to list entries as *items*.
# To access items in a list, use their *index*, which is their position in the list.
# Python lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first item is at position `0`, the second item is at `1`, and so on.

# **Example**:
# ```python
fruits = ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"]

# Accessing the first item
print(fruits[0])  # Output: peach
# ```

# In this example, `fruits[0]` retrieves the item at index `0`, which is `"peach"`.

# ---

### Applying String Methods to List Items

# You can apply string methods directly to items in a list.

# **Example**:
# ```python
fruits = ["peach", "apple", "orange", "pear"]

# Convert the first item to uppercase
print(fruits[0].upper())  # Output: PEACH
# ```

# In this example, `upper()` changes `"peach"` to uppercase.
